# BACSA Hacks - Closed Challenge Resources

The aim of the closed challenge is to create a forensics forensics support system that receives biological evidence from crime scenes and outputs a ranked list of suspects, confidence scores and an analysis explaining the reasoning. The two folders in this repository contain the format of files that will be used to test the final products developed in this hackathon. The folders also contain basic starter code that can be used to understand the fundamentals of **Fingerprint matching** and **DNA Analaysis**. 

**Note:** These files are merely a simplified example, during testing a much larger amount of suspect files may be used with more distorted/noisy data to determine the accuracy of each product. Therefore hackers are advised to not just stick the to the basic starter code but further develop it or even find newer more effecient/accurate ways of doing the same task.
